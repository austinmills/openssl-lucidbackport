Consolidating information on how to build a backport package of OpenSSL 1.0.0e
for Lucid. All of the original work was done by Vincent Bernat
<bernat@debian.org>.

Build Steps
-----------

1. `cd openssl-1.0.0e`

2. `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc`

3. .deb files are in the project root, so just install and go crazy.
